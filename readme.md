# University Project Drafts

This repository is intended for my personal storing and sharing of computer science project drafts (*theoretical or practical*) that I have dabbled in as I progressed through university and practiced more in this abundant field. Clearly, one can lose much of their work to damaged hard drives (*oh, the tragedy of life*).

But for any who might be interested in reviewing or using any of my work, feel completely free to step in. Though I should note that the final, cleaned versions of each project has its own repository for better exploration.

## Disclaimer

The files are purely experiential and may vary from university assignments to practical course projects. So **be warned, dear reader, that not all are pretty.**
